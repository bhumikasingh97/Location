<p> <p style="color:white;"> The tragic tale of two lovebirds that was cut up, and fed to the dogs. Literally. </p>
<p><p style="color:white;"> You know how cranky Indian families get while dealing with the whole idea of romance, right? What about being brutal? Cue dramatic, cliche tv serial music. </p>
<p><p style="color:white;"> A girl and a boy fell in love, but the boy's family didn't approve of the girl, since she came from a different section of society. Typical. </p>
<p><p style="color:white;"> The two of them planned on eloping, but after the family got to know about the situation coming up, they planned on getting rid of the girl. They took their son's phone, kept him home, and messaged the girl from his phone, telling her to meet under this peepal tree next to the Shiv Mandir temple, nearby, at midnight. The girl, having no idea about what's coming up for her, waits for her boy under the tree. Next thing you know, she was whacked on the head. After laying unconscious, she is brutally cut up, using an axe, and fed to the dogs right under the peepal tree. The person behind this was the father of the son. </p>
<p><p style="color:white;"> Turns out she was wearing an anklet, also known as a 'payal', and every since that incident, passerbys have complained about hearing the soft sounds of an anklet following them, and dogs collect under the tree around midnight, for no forseeable reason. </p>
<p><p style="color:white;"> Now coming to the point, here are the dares I have laid out for you:</p>
<p><p style="color:white;">1. Say "Bloody Mary" thrice.</p>
<p><p style="color:white;">2. Stand under the bell. Do the Suryanamaskaar 5 times, and after each round, ring the bell. </p>
<p><p style="color:white;">3. Give your friend documenting your dares, a dare, and make sure he/she does it. 
<p><p style="color:white;"> Remember, take videos and send them. Enjoy being a <p style="text-align:center;"> Daredevil. </p>
