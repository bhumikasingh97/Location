<p><p style="color:white;"> A pub? Really? Isn't that what's on your mind. But well, when there are drinks around, someone is bound to get into a fistfight and get knocked out.  Sounds like another cliché scene from a Hollywood movie, right? </p>
<p><p style="color:white;">This tale isn't even that old. It got enlisted only after the major barfight went down a month after it opened. Two friend groups got into a major fight at the pub, located near the police station. We don't really know the reason behind it but someone ended up pushing one of the guys against the bar, the bottle crashed and fell on him. He was unconscious, but after losing a lot of blood, died right on the spot. Since then, weird instances have been reported. Like, random people's drinks getting finished, without them doing so. Weird clinking and crashing noises against the bottles lined up at the bar counter.</p>

<p><p style="color:white;">You'd probably be needing a drink or two, for finishing the following dares-</p>
<p><p style="color:white;">1.	Go behind the counter and make a two drinks yourself.</p>
<p><p style="color:white;">2.	Serve those drinks to any two customers sitting in the pub, at that time.</p>
<p><p style="color:white;">3.	Be the DJ and make sure atleast 5 people are swaying to your beats.</p>
<p><p style="color:white;">These were pretty simple, right. But remember, take videos and send them. Enjoy being a <p style="text-align:center;"> Daredevil. </p>
