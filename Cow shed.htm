<p style="color:white;">

<p>The legend of this incredibly hungry and annoying ghost is as follows. </p>
<p style="color:white;">
<p>Initially, the shed was owned by a local, who had two sons. Before he passed away, he decided on distributing the land amongst his two sons, who would take care of it. The elder son got about 55% of the land, and the younger got the remaining 45%. Angry at how unjust the distribution of land was, he went on to kill his brother at midnight, in the cow shed itself. He, apparently, tied him against one of the poles, and beat him up. Due to his brother's death, the entire land eventually had to be given away to the younger one. 
But ever since his elder brother's death, there have been weird instances being reported by passerbys, and the family of the younger brother. People have heard two three cows moo really loudly, randomly at night all looking at the same pole, where the elder brother was tied and brutally killed. There also have been complains about a man screaming at night, around midnight, when there is no one around. </p>
<p style="color:white;">
<p>Every heard about a death in a cow shed? Shady right? Doesn't it give you heebie jeebies, just thinking about it. </P>
<p style="color:white;"> <p>Well, now that you know the infamous haunted story revolving around this shed, how about getting down to the business. 
Here are the three dares I have set out for you to complete, in this location -</p>
<p><p style="color:white;">1.	It's a cow shed. There is bound to be cow dung everywhere. Pick it up and throw it on your friend's shoe. 
It's pretty simple. Don't wuss out here only. </p>
<p><p style="color:white;">2.	Go smack two cows, until you make them moo. </p>
<p><p style="color:white;">3.	Ask a passer-by if they know about the story relating to the place, and if not, inform them and make sure they believe it. If they don't, find someone else and do. </p>

<p><p style="color:white;">And remember, take videos and send them to the Devil incharge. Till then, enjoy being a <p style="text-align:center">DAREDEVIL. </p>
