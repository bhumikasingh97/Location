<p><p style="color:white;">Aren't railway stations a really spooky place at night, especially if its not one of those major junctions, but the tiny platforms acting as pitstops for local trains, mostly. Well, the tale that revolves around this place is creepy.
It's believed that a few years after this station was set up, a carrier of one of the trains caught fire, and a lot of families, and people passed away instantly. No one till date knows why it happened, but apparently the souls still seek answers from the awaiting passengers at night. There have been reporting's, by a lot of wagon masters also, of a woman draped in a saree standing on the tracks, in the middle of the night. There have been feelings of uneasiness sensed by passengers waiting on the platform, an eerie feeling especially around 2-3 am. A few people have also heard screams, mostly of children, screaming and crying for help.</p>
<p><p style="color:white;"> Spooked yet? Yes?! No? Eh. Anyway, I have set out for the following dares for you to prove that you ain't shook by this story either- <p/>
<p><p style="color:white;"> 1.	Make sure you are either sitting or standing where there are a minimum of three people around. Then do an evil witch laugh, or try your best, and do this while pretending to read a paper or something.</p>
<p><p style="color:white;"> 2.	Convince an individual to use the bathroom of the railway station, because it will do them good by talking to the holy spirit who sits there, and will bestow her blessings on  the individual for future luck and happiness.</p>
<p><p style="color:white;"> 3.	Sit down somewhere on the ground, and try making atleast 10-15 rupees either by begging or doing something, like singing perhaps, which would help you gain that much.</p>
<p><p style="color:white;">Remember, take videos and send. Till then, enjoy being a <p style="color:red;">Daredevil. </p>
